# Revenues_predictions
 A predictive model based on SARIMA for forecasting the revenues for the next 15 days for a registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Data span the period between 2010-12-01 and 2011-12-09 and stem from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (publicly available).
 
 # Revenues_python
We calculate the revenues from the columns price and quantity and then we calculate the revenue per day. Subsequently, we plot the revenues series with time where we notice that it isn't stationary and the presence of an outlier. 

# Revenues_R
We use R for replacing the outlier (tsclean() function) and  building a seasonal ARIMA model (Box-Jenkins method).
